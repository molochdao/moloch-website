# MolochDAO Annual Report 2021

## 1. Background

MolochDAO was summoned on Valentine's Day 2019 at ETHDenver. Since the DAO Hack in 2016, the DAO concept was more or less on ice, with few people working on it. Ameen Soleimani, who had started at Consensys the very week that the DAO Hack started, had continued to think about the concept. In 2019, he set out to create a minimum viable DAO - few lines of code with less complexity to reduce risk.

At ETHDenver, Ameen asked a bunch of people for 100 ETH each to summon a grant-making DAO. (One ETH was worth ~$115 USD then.) Those became the core members of the DAO, along with Vitalik Buterin and Joe Lubin.

As James Duncan described in a Medium post at the time: "The beauty of Moloch is similar to that of the EVM. It is rudimentary, but the system works."

Moloch was active in 2019, and fairly dormant in 2020. But it still had funds in its treasury, and that ETH had appreciated in value considerably. In late 2020, Stellar Magnet started an initiative to reboot the grants program, and get the money working in the ecosystem as originally intended. She applied to MolochDAO for a grant to create an operational guild, which became known as The Really Boring Guild (RBG), which administers the grant program.

In 2021, The Really Boring Guild spearheaded an upgrade of the DAO. Shortly after MolochDAO was summoned, MetaCartel had forked the contract and launched an entire class of DAOs called Moloch DAOs, eventually upgrading the contracts to Moloch v2. But the original MolochDAO remained on version 1 - more correctly, MolochDAO WAS version 1 - while an entire ecosystem grew up around it. To solve for some issues in grant administration, RBG recommended the upgrade to v2, and after conducting due diligence and an open comment period, the upgraded DAO was summoned.

Two grant rounds were conducted in 2021, and we see new activity and new life in MolochDAO.

This is a look back at 2021 and what was accomplished, and a look forward at MolochDAO's evolution.

## 2021 Grants Program

### Grant allocation

In the year 2021, over $3,600,000 worth of ETH was granted by MolochDAO which is 33% higher as compared to 2020

**The Really Boring Guild - 2021 Year in a Glance**

January:

- StellarMagnet submitted a proposal to create a third party management dao for Moloch Dao called "Guild One"

March:

- TravisWyche joined "Guild One" and the group voted to rename the group to "The Really Boring Guild"

May:

- TravisWyche and StellarMagnet wrote the first Moloch Dao handbook which was based on the version one framework

June:

- The Really Boring Guild received a second grant for the year which refulled the Dao and was a signal of support from Moloch Dao on their efforts so far.
- StellarMagnet stepped down from the Dao
- AnneWillmott joined The Really Boring Guild
- There were discussions of shutting down Moloch Dao, but it was determined that there is still a lot of value in Moloch Dao

August:

- Moloch Dao was upgraded from version 1 to version 2 with the help of Dao-istilery group (members: Dekan, Ben, Spencer)
- The Really Boring Guild was responsible for transfering the treasury into the new framework which required a lot of research on how to transfer a large amount of funds in non-custodial way

September:

- Attended MCON in Denver and used it as an opportunity to represent Moloch Dao
- Ammen Soleimani (founding member) approved the direction of Moloch Dao and next steps at MCON
- Attended Wyoming Hack to help strengthen Dao to Dao relationships

October/November:

- Developed a road map to take into an account all the tasks and activities Moloch Dao had performed in the previous years
- TravisWyche created a second Moloch Dao handbook
- Towards the end of November it was determined that The Really Boring Guild was too centralized and that is should be disolved
  - The idea to disolve the group turned into an idea to sponsor Raid Guild season 3 cohort

December:

- The Really Boring Guild will have clear brand identity, community strategy, new website, and an annual report heading into 2022.

### DAO-to-DAO Relationships

intro paragraph on why this was important in 2021

#### Raid Guild

#### Meta Gamma Delta - supporting women-led

#### Uberhaus

we are the largest shareholder, travis is our delegate

#### DAOHaus

DAOstillery

#### MetaCartel

is the first fork of Moloch DAO but now we are coming back together for the benefit of the wider ecosystem

Both Moloch DAO and MetaCartel have a mission to accelerate and drive mass adoption of Web3. Initiative called Meta-Moloch aim to identify gaps in each groups funding activities. Goal is help identify areas where funds are needed most to help build infrastructure for a public good.

## 4. MolochDAO Network/Ecosystem Overview

## 5. Grant strategy

We reviewed the grant strategies of four other ethereum ecosystem funders (Gitcoin, Ethereum Foundation, Metacartel, EF RFP) and have some recommendations for the Moloch DAO to consider for its own grant making strategy. They include:

#### #1: Increased clarity

These programs often were very explicit about what they do and don't fund as well as their process. This helps people know when to apply and what to expect as they consider grant options.

We also found some programs offered informal conversations with select grant proposers to help answer questions and give guidance on what would help the grant get approved.

#### #2: Beyond money

The EF Ecosystems grant process offered many kinds of support beyond just monetary support. Some public goods goals require connections, publicity, mentorship, and advice. Offering these things beyond just money could be a big value add to the ecosystem.

#### #3: Quick responses

Some of the best programs we examined both mentioned fast responses and others said they heard back quickly. MolochDAO has multiple grants rounds per year and we can evaluate the idea of a rolling grants round in the future.

#### #4: Matching donations

By the time someone has gotten a grant approved they often have an exciting project. Some of the other grant programs examined offered matching donations as a way to multiply the effort of the grant application and impact of the proposal.

## 6. MolochDAO - Looking Ahead

### Fund Sustainability - Scenario Analysis

The goal of this analysis is to present a framework for allocating the MolochDAO treasury to the grant program. The amount the DAO should give away annually depends on the following:

- The desired goal of the DAO - would we like to expend funds quickly, or create a longer-term path for sustainability?
- The average price of ETH each year
  <br />

The DAO can look ahead, and evaluate these factors on an annual basis, setting a target amount to give away each year. This will inform the budget for each grant round, but will not restrict the DAO regarding the exact allocation of funds.

Specifically, this analysis considers three main factors: (1) the yearly USD price increase of ETH, (2) the increase in grant budget as a proportion of the ETH price increase, and (3) the budget allocation to the ReallyBoringGuild (RBG), for managing MolochDAO's operations. The model starts from 2021 and runs until 2035.

Of these factors, the most important and most complex factor is the price increase in ETH. It is difficult to know exact pricing trend of ETH on an annual basis given the many factors that go into its price. Modeling out a scientific ETH price prediction model is beyond the scope of this report. Therefore the main assumption that has been made is that the price will continue to increase on a yearly basis and the only difference will be how much it will increase.

Regarding the RBG budget allocation, this was kept at a constant 30%. This reflects the typical operations budget allocation of non-profit which usually ranges from 30-40%.

Lastly, the budget allocated to grants has a starting point of 20% based on 2021 numbers and is capped at 80% as it increases on a yearly basis. The cap is needed so the allocation does not exceed 100% of the treasury. Without the annual increase, the amount of grants given becomes too low as the price of ETH rises.

#### Scenarios

|                                                             | Scenario 1 | Scenario 2          | Scenario 3       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| ETH Price Increase                                          | Non-Linear | 50% annual increase | Doubles annually |
| Grant Budget Increase as a proportion of ETH price increase | 100%       | 50%                 | 30%              |
| RBG Operations Budget Percentage                            | 30%        | 30%                 | 30%              |

#### Findings

##### Scenario 1

This scenario reaches a peak of USD 4.1 million in annual grants given by 2023. After which, it steadily decreases to less than USD 1 million by 2027 and runs out by 2035.

##### Scenario 2

With a more predictable and larger price increase in ETH, this scenario peaks at USD 4.8 million in grants given by 2026 and decreases to less than USD 1 million in grants by 2030. The treasury also effectively runs out by 2035.

##### Scenario 3

The most aggressive scenario reaches a yearly peak of USD 23 million in annual grants given by 2027 after which it decreases to sub USD 1 million by 2031. It also runs out 2035 in terms of ETH but given the high ETH price increase assumed, there is some dollar value left albeit not much to make a significant impact.

### Recommendations

Further scenarios can be explored by adjusting the factors. As one can see, the change in ETH price has the biggest effect on the grant allocation. Other pricing trends can be explored based on market action and ecosystem developments that help appreciate ETH's value.

The proportional increase in grant allocation can be pushed higher as well to see more aggressive and higher impact scenarios in terms of ETH ecosystem development.

All in all, hopefully this serves as a foundational financial framework on how MolochDAO thinks about its grant allocation and strategy.
