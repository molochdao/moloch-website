# Q4 Proposal Flow

**November 1st: Exploration Phase - Applications are open!**

* Application should be posted on the Discourse forum to facilitate public debate
* Internal member conversation can happen in the dedicated #proposal-discussion Discord channel.
* ReallyBoringGuild (RBG) will encourage MolochDAO members to submit applications on the forum and to scrutinize other applications posted there.
* **RBG will not be submitting proposals on behalf of DAO members.**

**November 15th: Scrutiny Phase - Criticize!**

* Members are encouraged to provide feedback on their preferred proposals in the Discourse forum (public) and #proposal-discussion Discord channel. RBG will relay this information to the projects to help strengthen their proposal and schedule townhall meetings with the projects if desired.
* RBG will create polls for the strongest proposals to secure sentiment from members. This will occur in the #proposal-discussion Discord channel.
* Weak or undesireable projects will be removed from consideration at this time. “Bad fit” projects will be notified.

**November 29th: Submission Phase - Proposals Go On-Chain!**

* Projects that have gathered positive sentiment from the DAO will be invited to submit their proposal on-chain through the [DAOhaus portal](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x1/0x519f9662798c2e07fbd5b30c1445602320c5cf5b/proposals). Note: v2 Moloch DAOs allow anyone to submit a proposal, not restricted to members. 12 proposals can be submitted per day. **Proposals should not be sponsored at this time.**

**December 3rd: Deadline for Submitting Proposals**

**December 6th: Sponsorship and Voting Phase**

* DAO members that have expressed interest in championing specific projects will be reminded by RBG to sponsor the proposal at a **sponsorship price of 1 WETH.** _There is no processing reward on the v2 DAO,_ so **100% of these funds will be returned after the grace period** and gas fees will be reimbursed from the RBG budget. (Please keep your txn records!)
* Sponsorship will occur at a **MolochDAO member meeting (aka sponsorship party!) scheduled for Monday December 6th** to ensure they are opened to voting at the same time.
* The voting period is 7 days.

**December 13th: Results and Grace Period**

* All voting should be complete at this time, with some latency due to staggered sponsorship. We will know the results of proposals.
* RBG will notify MolochDAO members of their opportunity to Ragequit during the 7 day grace period.
* RBG will notify successfull applicants of their success and begin the onboarding process!

**Onboarding Process**

* Blast the grant announcements on MolochDAO social channels! Twitter, blog post on website, etc.
* Extend new MolochDAO handbook
* Invite to MolochDAO Discord server and update role to “member”
* Invite to reoccuring DAO meetings: RBG ops sync, Friday cocktail hour
* Invite to an orientation meeting for new grantees: **Friday December 17th**
* Encourage them to keep some of their shares and continue contributing to MolochDAO!

**December 20th: Proposals are Processed! End of the Pipeline**

* RBG (or any DAO member) can process proposals to make the results official.
