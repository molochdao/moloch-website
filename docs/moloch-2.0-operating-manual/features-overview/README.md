# Features Overview

### Members, Shares and Loot

The DAOhaus platform helps us manage stakeholders within our DAO (i.e. **Members**). **Members** are people or organizations that own **Shares** and **Loot** in MolochDAO. **Members** can own both **Shares** and/or **Loot**.

> When a **Member** owns **Shares**, they have an economic share of the funds in the DAO's **Bank**, as well as voting rights in the DAO's **Proposals**.

> When a **Member** owns only **Loot**, they only have an economic share of the funds in the DAO's **Bank**, but not voting rights in the DAO's **Proposals**.

Non-members can join the DAO by requesting for Shares / Loot via a Membership **Proposal**. **Members** can leave the DAO through a **RageQuit** proposal, thereby withdrawing their pro-rated ownership of the **Bank**'s funds.

### Proposals & Voting

Decision making is done via **Proposals**, which will need to be voted on by **Members** (based on their respective Share counts)

Common types of **Proposals** are:

- Membership - Tributing capital and Requesting new shares to join the DAO
- Funding - Tributing or Requesting funds from the DAO to work on internal projects and improvements
- Whitelist - Request to add support for a new ERC20 token
- GuildKick - Request to forcibly remove a malicious member through a vote
- Minion - A contract that allows execution of arbitrary calls i.e swapping assets in the DAO bank

The stages for **Proposals** are:

- Submit Proposal
- Sponsor Proposal
- In Queue
- Voting Period
- Grace Period
- Ready for Processing
- Completed

### Bank & Token

The **Bank** holds all the DAO funds, which include ERC-20 (excluding native tokens such as ETH, xDAI, MATIC on the respective chains) and ERC-721 NFTs.

> Native tokens must be wrapped first before being sent to the Bank. Alternatively, DAOs can set up a Minion that allows the holding of native tokens.

For an ERC-20 token to show up in the Bank's balance, the DAO must whitelist the token via a Whitelist Proposal (Tutorial here)

### Minion & Boosts

Beyond the core functions of managing membership, proposals and funds, DAOhaus has **Minions** and **Boosts** that help to add extra functionality to your DAO (you can think of them like apps)

**Boosts**, in general, give you extra functionality to your DAO (e.g. adding a Discord bot to your DAO).

If you need to interact with smart contracts (e.g. swapping tokens, managing LP positions, etc.), **Minion** help you with making arbitrary calls to smart contracts.
