Are you new to contributing and submitting PRs to open-source projects? [This link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/) from FreeCodeCamp is a good place to start.

**1. Go to MolochDAO website's Github to look for open issues**

### Working with HackMD

In order to contribute to Moloch docs, you will need to be able to write with Markdown syntax. It's extremely easy to learn. Use this [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to get started.If you have no experience cloning and working on a repository, you can make your edits or additions in [HackMD](https://hackmd.io) and then create an issue in GitHub that contains the Markdown copy. Just create a profile on Discord, and that can be linked to create a HackMD account.Here's how to contribute using issues:

1\. Create an issue in [https://github.com/yearn/yearn-docs](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-docs)

### Editing through the documentation UI

Another simple way to contribute is through the built in 'Edit on GitHub' button that you will see on all pages of Moloch docs. For this, you won't need to use HackMD at all, just make sure to have a GitHub account.

1\. Find the 'Edit on GitHub' button on the top right of the docs page.![](https://i.imgur.com/raB4DUB.jpg)

2\. Find the pencil button on the GitHub page that opens. It will say 'Edit the file in your fork of this project'

3\. From here, you will be able to edit any of the copy. Once you're finished, give your changes a title and a description at the bottom and 'Propose Changes'![](https://i.imgur.com/m4J2vKh.jpg)

4\. After you 'Propose changes' GitHub will create a branch of the yearn-docs repository for you and show a summary of the changes you made. If everything looks right and complies with the [Writing Style Guide](https://docs.yearn.finance/contributors/writing-style-guide), click 'Create pull request'5. In your pull request (PR), give enough context about your changes for the repo admin to understand why they should be accepted. Afterwards, click 'Create pull request' and the admins will either merge, deny or make a comment.![](https://i.imgur.com/iTGJanv.jpeg)
